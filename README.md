# PTCAccountChanger-OpenCV-PolygonSharp
 This was my attempt at creating an automatic account changer for Pokemon Go. 
 
 I used Polygon# to automatically input the referral code of the main account I wanted raid passes on and to automatically fight in the raids nearby. I would run this on new accounts to complete the referral challenges in order to get raid passes. 
 
 Very messy and could be done 1000x better with multiple devices and way better methods as I mainly focused on finicky time.sleep() calls, was mainly used to learn more about OpenCV and was a fun project. Resolution and coordinates may be off if you are using a different device other than a Pixel 2XL.
 
 Even started to create a window to potentially release for others to use with just a simple press of a button, got bored and stopped paying for the Polygon# service so this project quickly came to an end. Was a very fun learning process.
